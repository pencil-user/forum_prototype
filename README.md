------------------------

- Admin username is "admin" and password is "admin123"

- Server is deliberately slowed down to showcase chaching

- Forum uses markdown rules for formatting posts

- only admin can lock and pin threads. Only admin can delete and edit posts and threads not his own

- It is possible to register, but admin needs to approve you so you may post.

- search only looks for titles at the moment
